# Darkestville-Castle-Ch-2
SaveGamesForTesting

This is a savegame made for Darkestville Castle on a windows machine. It is somewhere in Chapter 2 (sorry don't remember where).

To use this file with your Steam copy of Darkestville Castle on windows 10, rename any existing save that you have under the folder appdata

LocalLow\Epic LLama\DarkestVille Castle to something else and unzip the file there - it should be called DarkestVille Castle in that location.
